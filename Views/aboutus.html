<h3 class="title">OUR STORY</h3>
<p class="story">In 2020 it started out as a fun project between five friends and would <br> later on in 2024 become a rising success. Second Chance to our <br>co-founders was a high school senior project and at that time they<br> couldn't have anticipated how important it would be to them. <br>After graduation they wanted to try to make the project idea real,<br> and since Egypt doesn't have thrifting stores like west it was easily <br>a unique idea that attracted many customers. A small business <br>started from there and the brand kept on growing attracting more people each day. </p>
